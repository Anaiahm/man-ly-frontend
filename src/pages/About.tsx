      <h1>About Manly</h1>
      <p>
        Men seeking mentorship, mental health support, and life resources often face fragmented access and social barriers that prevent them from finding guidance. At the same time, men willing and able to provide support lack a centralized way to connect with those in need. There is a need for a single, accessible platform that bridges this gap by connecting men to relevant resources and supportive providers in a structured and intentional way.
      </p>
        <p>Thats where Manly comes in. Manly is a web application designed to connect men with a wide range of supportive providers across categories like mental health, career, finances, and more. By creating a centralized platform that matches users with vetted providers based on their specific needs and preferences, Manly aims to break down barriers to access and foster a supportive community where Masculinity is redefined as strength through Mental Health, Mentorship, & More.</p>
